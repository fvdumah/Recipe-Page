## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt how to style li elements.
 - increase padding/margin 
 - change colour of markers
 - change font-weight of markers

```css
li::marker {
  color: #854632;
  font-weight: bold;
}

li {
  padding-left: 1rem;
}
```

### Continued development

There's a lot of things I would like to do differently.
Motto that got me through to solution is bad code is good code :D
Next challenge there a few things I would try differently 
- Display Image based on viewport (this challenge I struggled and just added the image )
- Style items in root first e.g font size, font-weight, colours.
